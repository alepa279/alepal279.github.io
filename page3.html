    </strong>
    <i>
        <p>by William Shakespeare</p>

    <p>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
        Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate</strong>. <br>
        Rough winds do shake the darlings buds of May, <br>
        And summer's lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
        And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds</sub>, <br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines, <br>
        By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:
    </p>
    <p>
            But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
            Nor lose possession of that fair thou owâ€™st, <br>
            Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade, <br>
            When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st. <br>
            So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, <br>
            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
